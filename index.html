                    <p class="text-muted">We arrived to Cancun a week after my graduation and I was so ecstatic to just go on a trip together!! I had the whole week planned: beach, ziplining, Mayan tours, etc. it was a pretty packed itinerary. So as soon as we we arrived to Cancun, he tells me he reserved a special, private cabana dinner that night on the beach so obviously my first thought was, “OMG he is going to propose! ...I think.” However, that all changed when it started POURING rain that day. I asked him, “should we do the dinner another day?” He shrugged his shoulders and said, “yeah okay.” Wellllll then, I thought if he was going to propose, then it wouldn’t of been so easy for him to agree to rescheduling the dinner. Everyone kept telling me he was going to propose on our trip, but I didn’t believe them for a couple reasons. 1. I always hinted to him if he was going to propose it would be so awesome if Mickey and Mushu were part of it and 2. When would of he gone to get the ring without me knowing?! and 3. He told me before he wasn’t planning to because everyone expects him to and it is too obvious lol.<br /><br />So we rescheduled the dinner for the LAST day we were in Cancun and the setup was so beautiful! The sun was setting down, we were sitting under a cabana on the beach and it was just me and him. We had an amazing 3 course dinner with wine and right before the dessert came out, he turned to me and said, “I can’t wait anymore,” and got down on one knee and proposed. I was so happy!! I grabbed the ring box and ooed and ahhed it and realized I hadn’t even said yes yet! I gave him back the box and excitedly told him, “yes!” and “put it on me!” and so after 5.5 years of being together, Chris and I finally became engaged on June 5, 2015! <3</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">I was so proud of Cherry for finishing graduate school that I booked a trip for us to Cancun as a graduation present. I picked out a ring for her and was deciding when to pop the question. Everyone assumed that I was going to propose in Cancun so I decided that I was going to either do it before or after the trip to throw her off. After much consideration, I decided to still propose at Cancun because I wanted her to be able to remember the trip and proposal forever.<br /><br />I contacted the concierge at the hotel and she told me about a romantic dinner on the beach that I thought would be perfect! I scheduled it for the first night, but when the time got close, it started pouring. I was still willing to have the dinner but she suggested to change the date to the last day that we were there. Since she suggested it, I knew it would throw doubt in her mind whether I was going to propose or not.<br /><br />The night of the dinner came. I fit a big box in my pocket that bulged out very far. I positioned myself so that she wouldn’t be able to see it as we walked down to the beach. The beach was very calming and soothing. The beach was pretty empty so it felt like it was just us. The dinner consisted of 3 course meals and was very delicious. After dinner I was planning on of walking down the beach and popping the question, but it started to get dark by the time dessert came. During dessert, I told her that I loved her and couldn’t wait anymore, and proceeded to get down on one knee. I was a bit nervous so when the time came to propose my speech slipped my mind. She loved the ring and pretty much grabbed it out of the box and tried to put it on herself! I said “What are you doing?! You didn’t even say yes!” She laughed, said yes and told me to put the ring on her finger and when we broke the news, everyone all said FINALLY!</p>

          <p class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">To be honest, we don’t really know how our relationship came to be. We knew of each other through mutual friends and had gone to some of the same events together, but didn’t really happen to talk until a year or so later after meeting one another! It happened one night at a small social gathering with all our friends that we really started conversating and getting to know each other and saw that we had a lot in common. We decided to exchange numbers, which led us to start texting and we quickly became best friends or what Cherry likes to call “bfffffffffs!” When the semester was over, we went back to our hometown for the summer and was talking everyday through texting, phone calls and emails and that is when we realized how “right” we were for each other and a new relationship arose!</p>

          <p class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">We came back to school around this time and started hanging out more. We officially became boyfriend and girlfriend on September 10, 2009! It is now six years later and we are still together stronger than ever and unlike Rachel Green  and Ross Gellar (from FRIENDS) we have never gone on a break!! Hahah! By the way we love that show. It is the first show we binged watch together and still watch it all the time-- best show ever!!</p>

          <p class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">During this time Mickey was staying at Cherry’s parents’ house cause her apartment didn’t allow dogs :( and she missed him a lot (Chris did too, but hates to admit it). Since she didn’t want to take him from her parents, Cherry kept bugging Chris about getting a new dog. He was pretty adamant on NO dogs so she decided to convince his best man, Jorge aka Caliber, who was totally down (he wanted to use him to pick up girls hahah). Thanks to Caliber, he found knew someone selling dogs in San Luis Obispo and when he showed me the picture of the shih tzus I knew I wanted to go. So we drove down there and once we saw Mushu, we knew he was the one for us (by the way, Caliber was the one that chose his name). At this point, we knew this relationship was a sure thing because you know, we adopted a dog together. We love him and Mickey so much!!</p>

          <p class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">We moved to the Bay Area (since that is where Cherry is from) to start a new chapter together. Also, Chris graduated Chico State and got a job offered in the Bay so everything was falling into place for us around this time. We packed up all our stuff in Chico, said goodbye to our friends and roommates and drove to the Bay in a Uhaul. A year later, Cherry started graduate school full time to get her Master’s in Education w/a Multiple Subjects teaching credential. </p>

          <p class="text-center" style="margin:20px;">Cherry graduated Mills College and got a new job offer. To celebrate her achievement, we decided to take our first REAL vacation together before she starts her new career. She was so excited about our first trip to Cancun that she created a whole iteniary, which included going to see one of the seven world wonder (Chichen Itza), swimming in the caves, ziplining at night, laying out at beach and pool and exploring everything there is in Cancun! Little did Cherry know, he was planning to propose the FIRST day we arrived, but that did not turn out as planned.</p>
